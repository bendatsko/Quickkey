# Quickkey


[Quickkey](https://quickkey.datsko.dev/) is a minimalistic typing test with word sets composed of an assortment of English's 1000 most common words.


## Instructions

- Select either 10, 25, 50, or 100 to generate a word set of the corresponding length.
- To begin a test, click within the text field to bring it into focus. At this point, a cursor will appear within the field signifying that you may begin typing at any time. As you type, characters that you type correctly will appear white, whereas incorrectly-typed characters appear red. 
- Once you have finished a test, you may view your words per minute and accuracy (expressed as "wpm" and "acc" respectively) in the top right corner of the text field. 
- You may generate a new word set of the same length by clicking the “reset” button beneath the word list container.
